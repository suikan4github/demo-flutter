   ```

## Build and run on Web
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   flutter run -d web-server
   ```
Then, you will see output similar to the following:

   ```
    Launching lib/main.dart on Web Server in debug mode...
    Waiting for connection from debug service on Web Server...         11.9s
    lib/main.dart is being served at http://localhost:43075
    The web-server device requires the Dart Debug Chrome extension for debugging. Consider using the Chrome or Edge devices for an improved development workflow.
