# Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/suikan4github/demo-flutter.git
   cd demo-flutter
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Build and run on Linux Desktop
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Build and run on Web
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   flutter run -d web-server
   ```
Then, you will see output similar to the following:

   ```
    Launching lib/main.dart on Web Server in debug mode...
    Waiting for connection from debug service on Web Server...         11.9s
    lib/main.dart is being served at http://localhost:43075
    The web-server device requires the Dart Debug Chrome extension for debugging. Consider using the Chrome or Edge devices for an improved development workflow.

    Flutter run key commands.
    R Hot restart.
    h List all available interactive commands.
    d Detach (terminate "flutter run" but leave application running).
    c Clear the screen
    q Quit (terminate the application on the device).
